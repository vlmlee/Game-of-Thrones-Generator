# Game of Thrones Generator

Inspired by Lisa Wray's [Fifty Shades of Gray Generator](http://www.xwray.com/), using a natural language generator called [the Dada Engine](http://dev.null.org/dadaengine/). 

It's not a Markov chain; instead, it is based on *recursive grammar*. You specify the rules of grammar, vocabulary, and the  sequence of *rules*, and the engine will construct your sentences by building a recursive transition network of those *rules*. From the documentation, a recursive transition network would look like this for a simple sentence:

```
sentence:                     +-----------+
                            +>| adjective |>+
          +-------------+   | +-----------+ | +------+  +------+
(start)->-| preposition |->-+------->-------+>| noun |--| verb |-(end)
          +-------------+                     +------+  +------+
```

And an atomic unit of grammer can be modeled this way:

```
adjective:       +---------+
             +---| "large" |--+
             |   +---------+  |
             |   +---------+  |
(start) -->--+---| "green" |--+-->-- (end)
             |   +---------+  |
             |   +---------+  |
             +---| "round" |--+
                 +---------+
```

With proper care, text generated by the Dada engine can be made to closely resemble human writing. We hope to create a specification that parodies some of the writing cliches of George R. R. Martin.
